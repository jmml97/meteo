Meteo is a project I am working on to learn SwiftUI.

⚠️ The app is not finished: neither design nor functionalities.

All suggestions are welcome, having in mind the considerations stated above.

## Building the app

You need macOS Big Sur Beta, iOS 14 Beta and Xcode 12 Beta.

In order to download data from AEMET you need an API key.
You can request one [here](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/altaUsuario).
